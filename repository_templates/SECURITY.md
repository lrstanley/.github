# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The following restrictions apply for versions that are still supported in terms of security and bug fixes:

   * Must be using the latest major/minor version.
   * Must be using a supported platform for the repository (e.g. OS, browser, etc), and that platform must
     be within its supported versions (for example: don't use a legacy or unsupported version of Ubuntu or
     Google Chrome).
   * Repository must not be archived (unless the vulnerability is critical, and the repository moderately
     popular).

If one of the above doesn't apply to you, feel free to submit an issue and we can discuss the
issue/vulnerability further.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Best method of contact: [GPG key](https://github.com/lrstanley.gpg)

   * [Discord](https://liam.sh/chat): message `/home/liam#0000`.
   * Email: `security@liamstanley.io`

Backup contacts (if I am unresponsive after **48h**): [GPG key](https://github.com/FM1337.gpg)
   * [Discord](https://liam.sh/chat): message `Allen#7440`.
   * Email: `security@allenlydiard.ca`

If you feel that this disclosure doesn't include a critical vulnerability and there is no sensitive
information in the disclosure, you don't have to use the GPG key. For all other situations, please
use it.

### Vulnerability disclosure expectations:

   * We expect you to not share this information with others, unless:
       * The maximum timeline for initial response has been exceeded (shown below).
       * The maximum resolution time has been exceeded (shown below).
   * We expect you to responsibly investigate this vulnerability -- please do not utilize the
     vulnerability beyond the initial findings.
   * Initial response within 48h, however, if the primary contact shown above is unavailable, please
     use the backup contacts provided. The maximum timeline for an initial response should be within
     7 days.
   * Depending on the severity of the disclosure, resolution time may be anywhere from 24h to 2
     weeks after initial response, though in most cases it will likely be closer to the former.
       * If the vulnerability is very low/low in terms of risk, the above timelines don't apply.
   * Before the release of resolved versions, a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory)
     will be released on the respective repository. [Browser all advisories here](https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago).
